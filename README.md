# Rubik's-cube-loading-
***Attempting to create a rubiks cube pattern for loading instead of the usual boring pattern***

#Idea :         
        There is a patter in rubik's cube that can be applied on a solved rubiks cube using **RUR'U'** [click here for notation](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/)
        and repeat these moves **6** times u get the solved rubik's cube back.
        This gives us a loading like effect.
        
#Design :

         Trying to make the colors of the rubiks cube floroscent or luminous(neon colors).
         give some shadow ellects
         give some 3d rotations
         give some hover effects
